This is a simple TCP/IP chat created to exercise concurrency concepts in Golang. The main aim of this project was to work with different concurrency primitives and learn more about the TCP/IP protocol. To make reading a more pleasant experience, I tried to narrow the scope of this project as much as possible, so it doesn't take much of the reader's time. This is why there are no advanced logging, error handling, input validation, or other features. The project may have some bugs since there are no tests to prove its validity, but overall, it works.


Maybe in the future:
- Unit tests
- Benchmark tests
- Add Pool of connections to improve performance
- Add timeouts for messages
