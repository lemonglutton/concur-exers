This project is simple implementation of golang's waitGroup. The main point of this project was to get more familiar with waitgroups, how they work, like also get better at golang concurrency primitives. This project has 2 types of implementation, this one is about implementing waitGroup in less efficient way using struct{} as a signal. This is less efficient way due to a goroutine with for loop which consumes CPU cycles checking all the time if can take over mutex. To remove this problem the cond sync primitive could be used - the implementation with cond is in other folder. This was one of the first projects I have written, when starting this repo and not planning to extend it
