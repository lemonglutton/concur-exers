This project represents a simple and direct implementation of Go's WaitGroup. Its main goal was to improve the developer's familiarity with waitgroups and Go's concurrency primitives. The project consists of two types, and this particular one implements WaitGroup in a more efficient way by utilizing the Cond primitive. This approach is more efficient than the struct signal method because it puts the goroutine to sleep, thus preserving CPU resources. Once the counter reaches 0, the broadcast function is called, and the main goroutine wakes up. This project was one of the first ones written when starting this repository, and there are no plans to extend it.
