This project is a simple implementation of Golang contexts. Its primary objective was to improve familiarity with contexts and gain a deeper understanding of concurrency primitives such as channels, timers, and once statements. To ensure a pleasant reading experience, I narrowed the scope of the project to minimize the reader's time commitment. Therefore, advanced logging, error handling, input validation, and additional testing were not included. The primary focus was to comprehend the main logic behind contexts and implement it effectively. As this project was mainly for learning purposes, it may contain some bugs.
