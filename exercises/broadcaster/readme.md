This is simple implementation of broadcaster in golang. 
The main point of this project was to create something cool like for example simple broadcaster to learn more about concurrency primitives like channels and contexts
To make reading a more pleasant experience, I tried to narrow the scope of this project as much as possible, so it doesn't take much of the reader's time. This is why there are no advanced logging, advanced error handling, input validation, here tests or other features. The project may have some bugs since there are no tests to prove its validity, but in overall main functionality should be working


Maybe in the future:
- Unit tests
- Benchmark tests
- Research on internet about more broadcasting features
