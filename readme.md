This repository is devoted to the study of Golang concurrency. Its aim is to collect knowledge on Golang patterns and gain experience in solving concurrency problems. The repository is divided into two sections: patterns and exercises. In the patterns section, you can find concise descriptions of most of Golang's essential concurrency patterns.

In the exercises folder, you will find five small projects that rely solely on Golang's concurrency primitives, such as mutexes, channels, and waitgroups and more. If you come across any errors or have ideas on how to improve this repository, please feel free to discuss them with me through creating issue or PR. I will be happy to talk about them!
